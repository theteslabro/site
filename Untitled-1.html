        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p>we started in 2020, then we thought we needed to create a brand that would bring beauty to other people s homes, we had no experience, nothing, the idea seemed meaningless to us and we put it on the back burner, and already in 2023, while in Italy, we began to develop our common hobby making candles</p>
